  # Hi there!


  I’m a Full-stack developer with a focus on React.js. My professional interests
  revolve around improving quality of life with technology. I prefer to work on
  projects that look beyond the bottom line and bring the highest level of
  quality and UX to their applications.


  Before I became a developer I was a recording engineer and musician. Working
  with bands and artists taught me the intricacies of collaboration and breaking
  down abstract ideas into actionable tasks. It also provided me ample
  experiences of troubleshooting in high stress situations.


  In my personal life I’m an avid consumer of fantasy and sci-fi entertainment.
  I still produce and record music, but on a recreational basis. I have two cats
  named Annie and Luna and I would love to travel to Japan one day.

      I led development on this site redesign. NKFM had an aged website that
      needed significant improvements in both the aesthetic design and the UX.
      This Wordpress website uses a custom theme based on the Genesis framework.
